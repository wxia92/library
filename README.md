Library App By William Xia

Description: 
This application is an online library for users to store books and their metadata. The user can input a new book by clicking on the "New Book" button and entering the title, author etc.

What I Learned:
I learned to use advanced css selectors to select a broad range of elements to style. For example, I used the div[class^="title"] style to select all of the title elements, instead of typing it all out. Also, each of the 5th and 10th book cards have no margins on the right side. To do this, I used the following selectors: div[class$="0"], div[class$="5"], to choose all of the cards that end in 5 or 10.
